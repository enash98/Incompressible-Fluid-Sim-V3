This gif shows the output of Fluid Sim V3.1 -- an improved version of Fluid sim V3.

The fluid is initially at rest, and the initial heat distribution is uniform.
There is no heat source/sink in this example, and the box is thermally insulated, so the heat distribution has little to no effect on the dynamics of the fluid
-- (the heat distribution is not visualised in this gif)

I have modelled a force that is localised in the botton left corner which acts to propel the fluid directly upwards, resulting in the formation of a current flowing clockwise
The fluid has relatively low viscosity

The quiver plot indicates the direction of the flow, and the heat map indicates the flow speed -- with blue indicating low speed, and red indicating high speed
